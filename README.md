# Complex-Problem
To maximize the efficiency of solar radiation collector, understanding the variation of solar radiation on the 
collector surface throughout the day is crucial. Factors such as the angle of incidence, solar altitude, air 
mass ratio, and atmospheric conditions significantly influence the total radiation received by the collector.
